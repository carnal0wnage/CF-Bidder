To search the lots, enter your search criteria and click on the <I>Search Lots</I> button. The text search searches the lot name and lot description. If searching by the opening or closing times, you must check the appropriate checkbox to indicate whether you want to search for times before, on, and/or after the time specified. You may also specify categories to which you would like to restrict your search. If you choose no categories, all categories will be searched. You may choose multiple categories.<P>
