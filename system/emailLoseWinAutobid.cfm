This automated email was sent by Emaze Auction to notify you that you either have a winning bid again or the quantity of your winning bid has increased. (This was likely caused by a bidder who was not willing to accept a partial quantity.) You do not need to raise your bid at this time. You will be emailed again if your bid is no longer a winning bid.Lot: #lotName#Current bid: #LSCurrencyFormat(getWinningBids.bidPrice,"local")#Maximum bid: #LSCurrencyFormat(getWinningBids.bidPriceMaximum,"local")#Initial bid: #LSCurrencyFormat(getWinningBids.bidPriceInitial,"local")#Requested quantity: #getWinningBids.bidQuantity#Quantity won at current price:  #getWinningBids.bidQuantityWin##systemURL#/lot.cfm?lotID=#Form.lotID#
