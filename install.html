<H2>Installation</H2>

<OL>
<LI>Create a directory for Emaze Auction in your webserver's public directory. This can be named EmazeAuction or whatever you wish. For the sake of convenience, we assume you named it <I>EmazeAuction</I>.
<P>
<LI>Copy all of the subdirectories within the <I>EmazeAuction</I> directory to the directory you just created on your webserver. There are 6 files you need to copy from the the <I>EmazeAuction</I> directory as well:
<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI>Application.cfm
<LI>initialize.cfm
<LI>index.cfm
<LI>category.cfm
<LI>lot.cfm
<LI>verify.cfm
<LI>market.cfm (<I>if you have the classified module</I>)
<LI>procure.cfm (<I>if you have the procurement module</I>)
</UL>
<P>
<LI>If you are using Microsoft Access 97, copy the database template, <I>emazeauction.mdb</I>, to your webserver. The database can be anywhere you choose. It does not need to be within the <I>EmazeAuction/</I> directory. Rather, it should be outside of your public directory where it cannot simply be accessed via a URL. You are welcome to rename the file to anything you want.
<P>
If you do not have Microsoft Access 97, you may use any SQL database. Please email us at support@emaze.com for the file to create the database. We have a script that works for SQL Server versions 6.5 and 7.0. It will probably work with Oracle as well.
<P>
<LI>Log into the ColdFusion Administrator and add the <I>emazeauction.mdb</I> database to the list of Cold Fusion datasources. You may name the datasource anything you want. Be sure to check that the datasource is working properly. If you are hosting with an ISP, you will need to have your ISP do this for you since they will not give you access to the ColdFusion Administrator.
<P>
<LI>We highly recommend you use the CF Scheduler for closing auctions. Register for the Scheduler to do the following:
<UL>
<LI>Run every hour or other time period you choose, depending on how often you close lots.
<LI>Run http://www.yourdomain.com/EmazeAuction/program/scheduler.cfm
</UL>
<P>
<LI>To initialize Emaze Auction, point your browser to: <I>http://www.yourdomain.com/EmazeAuction/initialize.cfm</I> . Fill in the appropriate fields and submit the form to initialize Emaze Auction.
<P>
<LI>If using a database other than Access, run the <I>createdb.cfm</I> script to set up the database. If you did not FTP the <I>createdb.cfm</I> script to your server, be sure to do so. Point your browser to: <I>http://www.yourdomain.com/EmazeAuction/createdb.cfm</I>.
<P>
<LI>Delete the <I>EmazeAuction/initialize.cfm</I> file from the server. If necessary, delete the <I>createdb.cfm</I> script as well.
<P>
<LI>To set up your auctions, point your browser to the Emaze Auction Admin screens at <I>http://www.yourdomain.com/EmazeAuction/admin/index.cfm</I>.
<PRE>   username: master
   password: emaze</PRE>
We strongly recommend you at least change the password after logging in. Just click on <I>Master</I> in the <I>User</I> section. You should also delete the initialize.cfm file.
