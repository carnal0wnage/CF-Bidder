CF-Bidder
=======
CF-Bidder is a ColdFusion Auction Project.

CF-Bidder permits the Use of Categories, Minimum Bidding and Maximum Bids.

It includes Databases in SQL-SERVER and MySQL Formats.

This is a simple Project I wrote Many Years ago, and before I lose my Archives I placed it here.

CF-Bidder also has an administration interface, where you can: 
	-Open/Close Auctions
	-Manage Autction Categories
	-Edit Items
	-Manage and Edit Bidding Logs
