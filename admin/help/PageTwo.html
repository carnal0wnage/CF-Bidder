This page allows you to import a large amount of users 
via a comma-delimited text file. The text 
file may contain any of the user fields, including: 
<P><B>
- Username<BR>
- Password<BR> 
- First Name<BR> 
- Last Name<BR> 
- Email<BR> 
- Organization<BR> 
- Phone<BR> 
- Address<BR> 
- Address2 (2nd line)<BR> 
- City<BR> 
- State / Province<BR> 
- Zip Code<BR> 
- Country<BR> 
</B>
<P>
You need to enter the path to the text file being imported and 
then choose the order in which the fields appear in the text 
file. The fields can be in any order. The file must contain at 
least one field. Many databases add the field names at the top 
of the file. So you can choose to either delete the first line 
manually or tell Emaze Auction to ignore the first line of the 
text file when importing the users. 
<P>
If the username is included in the list, Emaze Auction will only 
add those records which have unique usernames. It will return 
a list of users which were not added though.
