<HR>
<B>SELLER INSERTION FEES</B>
<HR>
<P>

	 
	 <B>Insertion Fee:</B><BR> 
	 This is the insertion fee that will be charged to a seller each time they create a lot with an 
	 item being bid on. This insertion fee is optional, and a "0" denotes no insertion fee.
<P>
	 <B>Multiply Insertion fee by lot quantity:</B><BR> 
	 This feature allows you to multiply whatever the value of your insertion fee is by the
	 quantity of items in a lot. 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    	 e.g if your insertion fee is $2.00 and a seller creates a lot with a quantity of 10 items,
	     then your insertion fee is : $20.00.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
	 <B>Vary Insertion fee rather than use above amount:</B><BR>
	 Insertion fee will vary based on the opening bid or reserve price based
         on a scale. If opening bid (or reserve price) is up to $X, insertion fee
         is $Y. 
<P>

	 <B>Use Reserve price instead of opening bid:</B><BR> 
	 in the above, use the reserve price instead of opening bid as the basis
         of determining what the insertion fee is. so this would be a higher $X
         above, and thus a higher $Y since the reserve price is higher than the
         opening bid.

<P>

 	 <B>Chart:</B><BR>
	 This chart allows you to set varying insertion fees that 
	 are based on the amount of the opening bid. 
<P> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	 e.g. In the first row (1.) : If you were to enter
	 a value of 0.50 in the "fee field" and $5.00
	 in the Upper range field. This would mean that
	 if an opening bid is up to $5.00 - the insertion 
	 fee is $0.50. 
<P>
 	 Continuing down the list, in the second row in 
	 (2.) you could enter a fee of $1 and upper range
	 of $10. This means that if the opening bid 
	 is between $5.01 and $10 the insertion fee for 
	 that item is now $1.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>
<HR>
<B>FEES FOR ADD-ON OPTIONS</B>
<HR>
<P>
 	 These options allow you the Admin to determine how much sellers are charges to 
	 have their lots featured and therefore become more prominent in various methods. 	 
<P>
         <B>Bold Lot Name:</B><BR>
	 This feature allows you the Admin to determine how much a seller is charged to have
	 their lot name Bolded amongst other lots in a category. If you are not offering
	 this option fill in a "0" in the field.
<P>
	 <B>Lot Featured On Category Page:</B><BR>
	 This feature allows you the Admin to determine how much a seller is charged 
	 to have their lot featured on a category page. If you are not offering this
	 option fill in a "0" in the field. 
<P>
	 <B>Lot featured on homepage:</B><BR> 
	 This feature allows you the Admin to determine how much a seller is charged
	 to have their lot featured on your website auction homepage. If you are 
	 not offering this opiton fill in a "0" in the field. 
<P>
<HR>
<B>SELLER COMMISSION FEES</B>
<HR>
<P>
	 This section allows you to determine what type of commission fees you will be 
	 charging sellers by default. 
<P>

	 <B>% of Revenue:</B><BR> 
	 This simply allows you the Admin to determine the percentage of revenue that is made of 
	 a lot by default. The default amount is 10%
<P>
	 <B>Minimum Amount:</B><BR> 
	 This is the minimum amount of what the commission fee will be on each 
	 lot that is opened by sellers. 
<P>
	 <B>Maximum Amount:</B><BR>
	 This is the maximum amount in US dollars, of what the commission fee will not be 
	 exceeded by default on all lots opened by sellers. 
<P>
	 <B>Vary commission percentage based on winning bid(s)</B><BR>
	 Like the varying insertion fee except a percentage.
<P>
	 <B>Calculate for each bid, not total of all winning bids for lot</B><BR> 
	 For the above, are the X values the total sum of all winning bids, in
	 which case the X will be larger; or do we calculate the proper Y based
	 on each individual X (bid * quantity) and then add them up for all bids
<P>
	 <B>Percentages apply in step fashion</B><BR>
	 rather than saying we get Y% of the winning bid, you get a certain
	 percentage for each step. this is how ebay does it. for instance, you
	 take 2% of the first $10.00 of a winning bid, 1.5% of the amount between
	 $10.01 and $50.00, and then 1% of anything above that
<P>
	 so if the winning bid were $100, you would get:<BR>
	 (2% of 10) + (1.5% of 40) + (1% of 50)
<P>
	 if the winning bid were $30, you would get:<BR>
	 (2% of 10) + (1.5% of 20)

	 lot(s) that they are opening. 
<P>

	 lot will close at the default time set by the Admin in the default lot options.
<P>

	 This option will give the seller control of the closing time of a lot, but 
	 the lot will close at the default date set by the Admin in the default lot options.

<B>BID INCREMENT</B>

	 his or her lots that he or she creates.	
<P>
	 <B>Vary bid increment based on amount of opening bid:</B><BR>
	 Similar to the insertion fee. basically, If the seller wants the bid
	 increment to be higher for items that have higher opening bids, this
	 lets you do that. If opening bid is $X, bid increment
	 is $Y.
<P>
	 <B>Use reserve price instead of opening bid:</B><BR>
	 This will allow sellers to choose their reserve price as an opening bid instead of

This page simply contains a set of functions that allows you as the admin to 
determine which information about the bidder and his/her bid the seller
is permitted to see. This can be for during the auction and after the
auction has ended. So you as the Admin can say, "you can't see their email address
until after the auction has closed." This way the seller can distinguish between
winning bidders and all (winning and non-winning) bidders.

 	 <B>TEXT VERSION FOR E-MAIL:</B><BR> 
	 This version of the Seller User Agreement will be sent via e-mail to the seller that is 
	 registering to auction off items on your website. This in effect should be the same
 	 agreement that is used on the website. 
<P>
	 <B>MESSAGE WHEN A SELLER USER AGREEMENT IS ACCEPETED:</B><BR>
