This page allows you as the Admin to manage the default settings for all your lots. This means
that any new lot that does not have any predetermined lot specifications created by either the 
Admin or the seller, will acquire these default settings:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
 	 <B>OPENING BID:</B><BR> 
	 This is the default opening bid for any lot any item in US dollars.

	 increased by) in US dollars.
<P>

	 A future feature currently being developed. 
<P>
	 <B>RESERVE PRICE:</B><BR> 
	 This is the default reserve price that will appear in all lots by default. This means that $5.00
  	 USD is by default the minimum price to which a lot has to be bid on before the seller loses the 
	 right to retain the object being auctioned off. 
<P>
	 <B>IMAGE:</B><BR> 
	 This is the default directory that you will store your full sized product images in for display 
	 in each lot. 
<P>
	 <B>THUMBNAIL:</B><BR> 
	 This is the default directory that you will store your thumbnail sized product images in for display
	 in each lot. 
<P>
 	 <B>DEFAULT LOT OPENING TIME:</B><BR>

	 lots. The Admin can choose to make it any of the following combinations:
<P>
	 a) Day of the week + Time<BR> 
	 b) Day of the week + Number of hours and minutes after the next hour<BR> 
 	 c) Number of days after current date + Time <BR> 
	 d) Number of days after current date + number of hours and minutes after the next hour
<P>
	 <B>DEFAULT LOT CLOSING TIME:</B><BR>

	 c) Number of days after opening date + Time<BR> 
	 d) Number of days after opening date + Number of hours and minutes after opening time
<P>
 	 <B>CLOSE BASIS:</B><BR>
	 This allows you the Admin to set a default close basis for each of your lots. This means
	 that by default all your lots will close according to one of the following: 
<P>
 	 a) Time<BR> 
	 b) Time + Inactivity (in whole minutes)

This page details some of the options in which e-mail send outs upon the closure of a lot are determined. 
Below is a full explanation of each section:
<P>

<HR>	 
<B>AUTOMATIC E-MAILS</B>
<HR>
<BR>
This section talks about the automatic e-mails that are sent out upon closure of a lot. 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	 >> <B>Automatically e-mail lot contact person to notify them that auction has closed</B><BR>
	    (this can be turned on or off)
<P>
	 >> <B>Include list of winning bidders in e-mail</B><BR> 
            (this includes a list of winning bidders in the automatic e-mail send to the lot contact person. 
            This can be turned on or off)
<P>
	 >> <B>Automatically e-mail winning bidders (who choose option)</B><BR>
            (This allows you to have the system automatically e-mail the winning bidders that have chosen to be 
 	    e-mailed upon a winning bid.) (This feature can be turned on or off)
<P>
	 >> <B>Automatically e-mail losing bidders (who choose option)</B><BR>
 	    (This allows you to have the system automatically e-mail the losing bidders that have chosen to be 
	    e-mailed upon a losing bid.) (This feature can be turned on or off).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<HR>
<B>SENDING E-MAILS: CF SCHEDULER VS EMAZE AUCTION SCRIPT</B>
<HR>
<BR>
In this section you can choose to use the Cold Fusion scheduler to send the automated e-mail in the auction system. 
If you choose this option, the Cold Fusion scheduler must be registered in the CF Administrator. 
<P>
<HR>
<B>EXTENDING CLOSING TIME IF NOT BIDS ARE RECEIVED FOR A LOT</B>
<HR>
<BR>
This section allows you to determine if you as the Admin want to extend lot closing times if no bids have been made 
in the lot by default. 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	 <B> >> E-Mail Lot Contact Person</B><BR>
		This means that the system will e-mail the lot contact person telling them that at closing time 
                there have been no bids. At this time, if so permitted, the lot contact person may go into their lot 
	        and extend the closing time.	
<P>
 	 <B> >> Extend Lot Closing time [1] [hours(s)], [3] times.</B><BR>
	        This option lets you set a default extension time for all lots. The first field lets you determine 
                an integer. The next field lets you define the first integer that you entered in the first field. 
                This integer will be either a function of hours or days as represented in the second field. The 
                third field lets you determine how many times you would like to extend the lot closing time in 
	        this fashion for a lot that does not receive any bids. At the end of the specified time here, each 
                lot will close by default if not bid on.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B>RESERVE PRICE OPTIONS</B>
<HR>
<BR>
The following section is devoted to allow you, the Admin to create and manipulate different options regarding how 
the reserve price is handled on your auction website. 	
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 	 <B> >> When reserve is met, e-mail lot contact person.</B><BR>
             (this simply is an option to e-mail the lot contact person when the reserve price for that lot has been 
             met by a bidder) (this feature can be turned on or off).
<P>
	 <B> >> When reserve is met, email losing bidders to notify them</B><BR>
             (this is simply an option to e-mail the losing bidders for a lot when the reserve price is met) 
	     (this feature can be turned on or off)

		      (this feature can be turned on or off)
<P>
	              <B>Extend lot closing time:</B><BR>
		      (this allows you the Admin to determine a default extension time on lots that do not meet 
		      their reserve price. The first field has to be an integer, the second field defines the 
	              integer found in the first field as either hours or days. The third field is also an integer 
		      and defines how many times you want the time extension to apply if the reserve price is not 
		      met. (this feature can be turned on or off)
<P>

Below is a detailed explanation of each of the sections found on this page:
<P>
<B>STRICT BID INCREMENT:</B><BR>

<P>	
<B>AUTO BID:</B>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	    <B> >> DO NOT ALLOW AUTOBID ON ANY LOTS</B><BR>

	        that bidders can select using a checkmark box)
<P>

<P>
            <B> >> ALL BIDS AUTOMATICALLY USE AUTOBID</B><BR>

	        auto-bid feature)

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

		the correct bid before submitting it to the system.)
<P>
	    <B> >> All bids must be verified before they are submitted</B><BR>
	        (choosing this option will have the system perform a verification with the bidder to ensure it is

<P>
	    <B> >> Bidder has option of verifying bid before it is submitted</B><BR>

	        or her bid results)	
<P>
	    <B> >> Reload lot page after bid is processes</B><BR>

	        and simply reload the page to reflect the results of his or her bid.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>BID LOGIC:</B><BR>
