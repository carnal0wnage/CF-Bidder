To create a new category, you must choose a category name, designate which category the new category is a 
subcategory of, choose a button image, and page logo image, and choose the template to use when displaying that 
category. You may also enter a description, header, footer, and special message. The description is not currently 
used, but it was included for you to potentially use on the auction home page or category home page. The header, 
footer and special message are currently used in the default category template, but you can use them in any 
template you create as well. 
<P>
There are 4 category levels. The new category can be a new category, i.e., a level 1 category, or it can be a 
sub-category or an existing category. The existing category can be level 1, 2 or 3. To designate the new category 
as a level 1 category, i.e., it is not a sub-category of an existing category, select "NEW (SEPARATE) CATEGORY" 
in the sub-category select list. 
<P>
The new category name must be unique for that category level. A category name may be used more than once if they 
are not both level 1 categories or are subcategories of different categories. For instance, both of the following 
categories are acceptable: 
<P>
Computers: Books<BR>
Fiction: Books 
<P>
If the name is not acceptible, Emaze Auction will ask you to choose another name for that category.

This page serves as the control center for your templates. You can either
use the default templates that are present, edit the default templates,
or create new templates which you can later specify to be used in certain lots
or categories. 
<P>
Creating new templates and implementing them is a four step process:
<P>
1. Create the template and place it in the EmazeAuction/template/ directory. If the template is not already on the server, you will be given the option of uploading it directly. <BR>
2. Choose a name for the template and enter the filename. The file must end with ".cfm" . <BR>
3. Specify whether the template is for the auction home page, category home page, or lot page.<BR> 
4. Edit the category, lot and/or system to use that template. 
<P>
Using the table you can create a new template and then edit it or edit existing ones. 
You can also choose to delete templates, by choosing them from the 
most lefthand column titled: "Del" checkboxes, then checking 
the checkbox directly below the "Delete Template(s)" button.

The system options are the basic system paths, URLs and other settings used to run Emaze Auction. These include 
the same values you entered upon initializing Emaze Auction. To change any of the settings, you must check the 
checkbox for the change to take effect. (This does not apply to the two cookie checkboxes.) 
The domain name is the domain name and extension or the IP address. It is used to write a permanent cookie for 
users who choose the automatic login via cookie option. The domain name is also used for temporary cookies to 
ensure other servers cannot read them. If you are entering a domain name, be sure to include a period (.) before 
the domain name, e.g., ".emaze.com" . However, if you are entering an IP address, do not include the period, e.g., 
"127.0.0.1" . 
<P>

<B>Full path to Emaze Auction directory</B><BR> 
This is the path to the EmazeAuction directory, or whatever you named it. The path is from your server's root 
directory, e.g. c:\WebSite\htdocs\EmazeAuction. There should be no trailing slash at the end. 
<P>
<B>URL to Emaze Auction directory</B><BR> 
This is the URL to the EmazeAuction directory, or whatever you named it. It should be the full URL, e.g., 
http://www.yourdomain.com/EmazeAuction . There should be no trailing slash at the end. 
<P>
<B>Cold Fusion datasource of database </B><BR>
This is the name of the Cold Fusion datasource as determined in the Cold Fusion Administrator. 
<P>
<B>Email server for sending emails</B><BR>
This is the mail server to use when sending emails from Emaze Auction. 
<P>
<B>Logout URL</B><BR> 
This is the URL where Admin is sent after logging out of the Emaze Auction admin screens. Logging out deletes 
the cookie from the admin's browser. There is currently no logout feature for normal users. 
<P>
<B>Allow automatic bidder login via permanent cookie</B><BR> 
This enables users to bid on lots without entering their username and password. The permanent cookie stores the 
bidder's unique ID and username. Both are harmless without the proper password. (If the user changes his/her 
username, Emaze Auction will update the cookie with the new username.) 
<P>
<B>Use temporary cookie</B><BR> 
This enables bidders to submit multiple bids without re-entering username and password after first bid. This is a 
temporary cookie that is automatically deleted when the browser session ends. 
<P>
<B>Domain name (for cookie login: domain.extension)</B><BR> 
The domain name ensures that only your server can read users' cookies. The domain name should be simply 
"domain.com," e.g., emaze.com
