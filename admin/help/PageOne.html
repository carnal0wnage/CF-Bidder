Create a directory for Emaze Auction in your webserver's public directory. This can be named EmazeAuction or whatever you wish.
For the sake of convenience, we assume you named it EmazeAuction. 
<P>
<B>2)</B><BR>
Copy all of the subdirectories within the EmazeAuction directory to the directory you just created on your webserver. There are 4
files you need to copy from the the EmazeAuction directory as well:

If you are using Microsoft Access 97, copy the database template, emazeauction.mdb, to your webserver. The database can be
anywhere you choose. It does not need to be within the EmazeAuction/ directory. Rather, it should be outside of your publicdirectory. You are welcome to rename the file to anything you want. 
<P>
If you do not have Microsoft Access 97, you may use any SQL database. Please email us at support@emaze.com for the file to create
the database. We have a script that works for SQL Server versions 6.5 and 7.0. It will probably work with Oracle as well. 
<P>
<B>4)</B><BR>
Log into the ColdFusion Administrator and add the emazeauction.mdb database to the list of Cold Fusion datasources. You may
name the datasource anything you want. Be sure to check that the datasource is working properly. If you are hosting with an ISP, you
will need to have your ISP do this for you since they will not give you access to the ColdFusion Administrator.

We highly recommend you use the CF Scheduler for closing auctions. Register for the Scheduler to do the following: <BR>
Run every hour or other time period you choose, depending on how often you close lots.<BR> 
Run http://www.yourdomain.com/EmazeAuction/program/scheduler.cfm

If using a database other than Access, run the createdb.cfm script to set up the database. If you did not FTP the createdb.cfm script
to your server, be sure to do so. Point your browser to: http://www.yourdomain.com/EmazeAuction/createdb.cfm.

<FONT FACE=VERDANA SIZE=-1>
<A NAME="TERMINOLOGY-ADMIN/MASTER">
<LI><B>ADMIN / MASTER</B>:<BR>
User who has access to the admin screens. At this time, the 
system supports only a single admin user. 
<BR>
<A NAME="TERMINOLOGY-LOT">
<LI><B>LOT</B>:<BR>
What is being auctioned off. Can be a single or multiple quantity. If multiple, you can 
limit the maximum quantity each bidder may win. A lot can be public, meaning all users may 
bid on it; or private, where users must be given permission to access that lot. 
<BR>
<A NAME="TERMINOLOGY-CATEGORY">
<LI><B>CATEGORY</B>:<BR>
Each lot belongs to a category. Each category may have up to 3 sub-category levels, 
providing 4 category levels in all, e.g., Computers : PC : Laptop: Accessories. Please note
that most of the Lot options are hidden in the Category section. Each lot is part of a 
category, so to perform lot actions (other than creating new lots) you must begin with the 
appropriate category. 
<BR>
<A NAME="TERMINOLOGY-AUCTIONHOMEPAGE">
<LI><B>AUCTION HOMEPAGE</B>:<BR>
Lists all primary categories (e.g., Computers). Our template lists up to 10 lots which open 
today, and up to 10 which close today. Provides space for a special message or hot deal, and 
a form for users to edit their information or check the status of all of their bids. Also 
includes header and footer options. 
<BR>
<A NAME="TERMINOLOGY-CATEGORYHOMEPAGE">
<LI><B>CATEGORY HOMEPAGE</B>:<BR>
Page for that category. Lists all lots in that category. Our template lists open lots and all 
lots which have closed in the past 7 days. Lists all categories and sub-categories for the 
category you are in. Provides space for a special message or hot deal, and a form for users 
to edit their information or check the status of all of their bids. Also includes header and 
footer options.
<BR>
<A NAME="TERMINOLOGY-TEMPLATE">
<LI><B>TEMPLATE</B>:<BR>
Design for how the auction home page, category home page, or lot page is displayed. We include 
a single template for each type of page. You may customize these templates or create your own. 
In the future, we will offer additional templates. In the meantime though, you may use our 
templates as a reference for your own. The templates are not encrypted, so you have full access 
to the Cold Fusion code. 
<BR>
<A NAME="TERMINOLOGY-BIDDERUSER">
<LI><B>BIDDER / USER</B>:<BR>
Must be registered to bid on a lot. For private auctions, bidders must log in to ensure they 
have permission. You will notice the terms "user" and "bidder" used interchangably. Users and 
bidders are the same thing. However, we typically use the term user because Emaze Auction was 
designed to integrate with Emaze Forums, our discussion forum program. This enables you to 
maintain a single user database for both programs, enabling bidders to easily join a discussion 
forum on that lot or on other topics. 
<BR>
<A NAME="TERMINOLOGY-BID">
<LI><B>BID</B>:<BR>
Bidders bids with their initial bid, desired quantity (if more than 1), whether they will accept 
partial quanlity or full quantity only (if more than 1). They can also use the auto-bid feature, 
if Admin permits it. 
<BR>
<A NAME="TERMINOLOGY-AUTOBID">
<LI><B>AUTO-BID</B>:<BR>
Admin must enable this feature. Allows users to enter the initial bid and their maximum bid. Emaze 
Auction will automatically increase their bid the necessary amount to ensure they win at least one 
quantity. If they will accept only the full quantity, it will stop auto-bidding once they can no 
longer with the full quantity with their maximum bid. Some auction sites automatically do 
auto-bidding, but we decided against this to allow Admin to deterine whether to allow this. 
Our method also allows a bidder to choose their initial bid
<BR>
<A NAME="TERMINOLOGY-SELLERS">
<LI><B>SELLERS</B>:<BR>
A seller is an individual who when registered may begin creating lots of items which he or she 
would like to auction off. As the Admin, you may choose to have the option of having to approve
each lot before it opens so that sellers are restricted in that sense. 
<BR>
<A NAME="TERMINOLOGY-COOKIES">
<LI><B>COOKIES</B>:<BR>
Small text files that are used by browsers to most commonly either track users and enhance their
online experience, or to track users and learn abou visitors' browsing habits.

Currently the Emaze Auction software handles a number of automated e-mail processes that
benefit both the end user and the website owner. Here is a list of the automated e-mail

within, in the Admin area.

Closing lots in Emaze Auction is a 2 step process: 
<P>
<LI>Update the lot status so that users do not mistakenly believe the lot is still open to 
bidding. 
<LI>Send the necessary e-mails to the contact person for that lot, and to all winners and 
losers who requested to be notified (assuming the Admin permits the automated emails). 
<P>
The two components are separated because Cold Fusion is not inherently designed to create
applications which require actions to be performed at a specific time. The Enterprise version of Cold
Fusion (which costs $1000) offers a Scheduler in the Administrator, which enables you to
automatically run a Cold Fusion script at a designated time or interval. Other than the Scheduler
though, it is not possible to say, "Close the lot at 5:00 PM." and have Cold Fusion just do it. So we
had to hack it for our purposes. 
<P>
Emaze Auction maintains 2 lists: 
<LI>Lots which are currently open 
<LI>Lots which are closed, but the emails still need to be sent 
<P>
Every time a page is loaded by a user, Emaze Auctions checks whether any open lots need to be
closed. If so, Emaze Auction adds the lot(s) to the queue of closed lots waiting to have the e-mails sent.
This is a simple script that will not significantly affect user's experience or place undue burden on the
server. Emaze Auction does not automatically send the emails because that takes additional time, and
would affect the user's experience. (This is because Cold Fusion does not allow you to send HTML to
the browser while the page is still being processed.) 
<P><DIV CLASS="area">
If you have the Enterprise version of Cold Fusion, or are hosting your site with an ISP that uses the
Enterprise version, you have access to the Scheduler via the Cold Fusion Administrator. The
Scheduler enables you to run a script without requiring a user to wait while it executes. Most ISPs will
allow you to run a simple script through the Scheduler. However, if your ISP is wary of doing this, feel
free to have them contact us at <A HREF="mailto:sales@emaze.com">sales@emaze.com</A> and we will be happy to assure 
that the script will not place undue burden on their server. 
</DIV><P>
<B>The script that you should run via the Scheduler is:</B><BR>
http://www.domain.com/program/scheduler.cfm 
<P>
If you have lots which close at all hours, we recommend running the script every hour. However, if
your lots tend to close at the same times, you can set up the script to run only at those times. If you are
using the inactivity setting, such that an auction will remain open past the closing time as long as there is
still active bidding, be sure to run the script after the closing time, e.g., 30 minutes. This will provide
enough time for most auctions to actually close. 
<P>
If you do not have access to the Scheduler, either because you are not fortunate (and wealthy) enough
to have the Enterprise version of Cold Fusion or because your ISP will not allow you to use the
Scheduler, all is not lost. Emaze Auction can still send the emails automatically. When Emaze Auction
checks whether any lots need to be closed, if the scheduler is not being used and no lots need to be
closed at that time, it will send the automated emails for one lot in the queue. This ensures that each
user will not endure a long delay. 
<P>
In the Options section of the Emaze Auction Admin screens, you are asked to designate whether you
are using the Cold Fusion Scheduler. If you are not, then you can choose to either have Emaze
Auction send the automated emails or choose to send them manually. (Manually does not mean that
you must send the email to each user individually. Rather, the Admin screens provide a button for each
lot to automatically send the emails to the winners and/or losers if the emails have not already been
sent.

Emaze Auction utilizes client-side JavaScript to move some of the processing from the server to the
client. JavaScript is used extensively in the forms to ensure that all fields are properly completed. This
is much more efficient than submitting a form, only to have the server send back an error message that
either a required field is not completed, or the field does not contain the proper type of data. Because
it is done using JavaScript, the user will not be permitted to submit the bid until the form is completely
properly. 
<P>
JavaScript is used extensively in the Admin screens. However, it is also used in various parts of the
user interface, primarily on the bid form for the following purposes: 
<P>
     <LI>Ensure the user enters their username and password if they are not using a cookie. 
     <LI>Ensure the user enters a bid as a number value, the bid is at least the minimum bid necessary to
     win at least 1 quantity, and the bid is at least greater than the previous bid by the bid increment. 
     <LI>Ensure the user enters a quantity as a number and that the quantity is less than or equal to the
     maximum quantity allowed. 
     <LI>When using the auto-bid feature, ensure the user enters a maximum bid which is at least one bid
     increment greater than their initial bid. 
<P>
Please note that Emaze Auction uses JavaScript only via Cold Fusion's integrated JavaScript
functionality for web forms. While we are not currently aware of any browser or platform
incompatibilities in Cold Fusion's JavaScript code, we recommend that users be using at least
Netscape Navigator 3 or Microsoft Internet Explorer 3. Regardless, Emaze Auction incorporates
server-side checks for these tests as well. However, use of client-side JavaScript can reduce stress on
the server for those users who have a browser which supports these JavaScript features.
